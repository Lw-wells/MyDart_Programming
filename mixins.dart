// Mixins are the cool kids of the coding playground! 🌟 They let you reuse code across different class hierarchies without making a messy sandwich of inheritance. 🥪✨

// Imagine you have an Employee class rocking methods like clockIn. Now, both a Bartender and a Nurse can benefit from this functionality. But wait—what if you have a Doctor who also needs the takeTemperature magic, but you don’t want to bloat the Employee class? 🤔

// Enter the Mixins! 🎭💥 By creating a mixin called Medical, you can sprinkle that doctorly functionality wherever it’s needed—without the extra baggage! It’s like having your cake and eating it too! 🍰🎉

mixin Walker {
  // Declares a 'mixin' named 'Walker'. Mixins are reusable bundles of code/behaviors.
  void walk() {
    // Defines a method named 'walk' within the Walker mixin.
    print('I can walk!'); // Prints a message indicating the ability to walk.
  } // Closes the 'walk' method definition.
} // Closes the 'Walker' mixin definition.

class Animal with Walker {
  // Declares a class named 'Animal' and uses the 'with' keyword to "mix in" the 'Walker' behaviors.
  // ... other animal stuff // This is a comment indicating where other class members (variables, methods) for Animal would go.
} // Closes the 'Animal' class definition.

void main() {
  // Defines the 'main' function, the entry point of the Dart program.
  var dog =
      Animal(); // Creates a new instance (object) of the 'Animal' class and assigns it to 'dog'.
  dog.walk(); // Calls the 'walk' method on the 'dog' object. This method comes from the 'Walker' mixin. // Output: I can walk!
} // Closes the main function definition.
